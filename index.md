## [ML Algorithms](https://github.com/turnerluke/ML-algos)

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/turnerluke/ML-algos)

A collection of self-made machine learning algorithmns. Algorithms are created with the intent of better understanding the processes behind each machine learning algorithm, as well as to communicate technical data science information.  

Currently the following algorithms have constructed:
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
- K-Means Clustering
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier Neural Network
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor Neural Network
- Gradient Descent Least-Squares Optimization with Regularization

I got my start in Data Science blogging by writing about these algorithms on Towards Data Science, see my [Medium posts here.](https://medium.com/@turnermluke)

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/turnerluke/computational-presentations)

A repository of my presentations from spring 2021 teaching computational coursework to chemical engineering undergraduate students. The course topics were set by the university, however these presentations and the examples with their code were made entirely from scratch.

Coursework coved a variety of numerical methods and data operations, including but not limited to:
- Coding fundamentals
- Data visualizations
- Data operations
- Interpolation
- Solving nonlinear systems of equations
- Numerical integration
- Nonlinear parameter estimation (least squares optimization)
- Numerical solutions to differential equations
