## [ML Algorithms](https://github.com/turnerluke/ML-algos)
A collection of self-made machine learning algorithmns. Algorithms are created with the intent of better understanding the processes of these ML algos.  
Currently the following algorithms have been made:
- k-Nearest Neighbors Classification
- k-Nearest Neighbors Regression
- k-Means Clustering
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier Neural Network
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor Neural Network
- Gradient Descent Least-Squares Optimization with Regularization
I got my start in Data Science blogging by writing about these algorithms on Towards Data Science, see my [Medium posts here.](https://medium.com/@turnermluke)
