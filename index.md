A web app, created in Flask and deployed on Heroku, takes the users input as a digit drawing on a canvas and outputs a prediction. This app is my over-engineered take on the "Hello World" of neural networks, digit prediciton from the MNIST dataset, which takes the project all the way to a deployed model on a polished website. While many of the technologies used may not be needed in a Data Science role (web developement/deployment, HTML, JavaScript, css, etc), I believe the ability to present a ML model with no technical jargon and the ability to quickly learn new technologies are critical qualities of modern Data Scientists.

[![Medium](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Medium&message=View%20on%20Medium&color=red&style=for-the-badge&logo=Medium)](https://medium.com/@turnermluke)


A collection of self-made machine learning algorithmns. Algorithms are created with the intent of better understanding the processes behind each machine learning algorithm, as well as to communicate technical data science information.  

Currently the following algorithms have constructed:
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
- K-Means Clustering
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier Neural Network
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor Neural Network
- Gradient Descent Least-Squares Optimization with Regularization

I got my start in Data Science blogging by writing about these algorithms on Towards Data Science, see my [Medium posts here.](https://medium.com/@turnermluke)

## [Computational Presentations](https://github.com/turnerluke/computational-presentations)

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/turnerluke/computational-presentations)

A repository of my presentations from spring 2021 teaching computational coursework to chemical engineering undergraduate students. The course topics were set by the university, however these presentations and the examples with their code were made entirely from scratch.

Coursework coved a variety of numerical methods and data operations, including but not limited to:
- Coding fundamentals
- Data visualizations
- Data operations
- Interpolation
- Solving nonlinear systems of equations
- Numerical integration
- Nonlinear parameter estimation (least squares optimization)
- Numerical solutions to differential equations
